# HFI_digital_inclusion_challenge_2021
This is a side project I and two other team members have done during the summer of 2021. We were competing in the digital inclusion challenge held by Henry Ford Inovation Institute.
Though we did not made it to the top list, but it is the genuine passion to care for the patients and the team spirit that have made me so proud.
This repository serves as the summary for two-month hard work, and also sending out a message that "You can do it too!". We are listing the details and lessons we have learned, 
any feedback and comments are welcome at mandyzong@gmail.com.

## Inspirations
"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." - Marie Curie

We wanted to add on visual effect to purely verbal communication by means of technology such as 3D printing and AR/VR during the concultation.
So our physicians and patients get to enjoy both medical education and technology education at the same time.

## 3D Printing
We purchased the best selling 3D printer from Amazon (Creality Ender V3) and printed out models from thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/) where 
numerous 3D printing models are free to download. Within the two months starting from scratch, challenges about maintence came one after another, but got solved eventually. We have summarized in the folder of 
"3D-printing". For this particular challenge, we printed and assembled a linear accelrator (radiation therapy machine - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1804228).

Slicing software: Ultimaker Cura.\
Photo Editing APP: Photoleap.

## AR APP
We then wrote an IOS based APP using ARkit to track the model/parts and impose text and images on it. We followed the ARkit image tracking tutorial on Youtube. 
Videos of the APP can be found in the folder of "AR".

## Brochure
We made a brochure too. And yes the motivation comes from three most important people to me: my parents and my son, who taught me to stay healthy, strong, happy and kind. 
I love you! Brochure making APP: Canva.
